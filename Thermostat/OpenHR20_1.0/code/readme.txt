/ doc 
    For everything about documents that were created by yourself.
    Specs that you can get on the internet do not belong here, 
    they just make it all unnecessarily big and it takes time to check out
    longer.

/ Playground
    As the name implies, to play around and test.
    Here comes any kind of code snippets that are there to test 
    and (currently) not yet part of the program.

/ source
    Here comes the application with all modules and makefiles.

Please keep the repository clean and only check in files that make sense 
make, "thumbs.db" or other temp files do not belong here.

Dario.
